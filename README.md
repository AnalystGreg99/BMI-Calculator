# BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented in Python. It prompts the user to enter their name, height in centimeters, and weight in kilograms, and then calculates their BMI and determines their BMI category.

## Example

```
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your height in centimeters: 180
Enter your weight in kilograms: 75

John Doe, your BMI is: 23.15
John Doe, you are Normal
```
